This website primarily consists of a Player Comparison guessing game and a Team Guessing game. 

1. The Player Comparison is inspired by an all-too-common practice employed on basketball forums since time immemorial. If you think your guy is underrated, find another, better regarded, player with similar boxscores. Then you can post both and challenge other users to guess which is which. This way you can make your point while ignoring all context to the statistics! 

   For the website, the game will give two players and two statlines. The user will drag each player name to the statline they think coorelates to each player. The game will then evaluate if the user chose correctly or not. 
2. The Team guessing game comes from a brilliant segment from the basketball analysis TV show "Inside the NBA". In the show an ex-player analyst is challenged to determine "Who he play for?". Usually this purported expert will fail to identify any players' teams correctly, to humorous effect.

   On the website the game is played by clicking the button to get a random player and then clicking the correct team icon below. Users will need to switch the display between East and West to toggle the 15 teams in a given conference.
